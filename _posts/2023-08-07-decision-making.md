# Motivation
It seems that all common programming problems are widely covered in world wide web. For instance, Whenever I encounter a problem that requires usage of a tool or API that I am unfamiliar with, I don't expect to spend a lot of time searching for documantion, examples of usage, or even step by step tutorials in a form of blog post or a video. 

The real issue begins when the complexity of your app grows and you are required to solve a problem that is composed of many, let's call them sub-problems. That means, that your puzzle is rather complex and:
- You can't just find a solution online
- You might not want to, or even be able to share all of your source code to StackOverFlow
- You either can't use LLM's to get help or even if you could, why would you follow the answer blindly?

Then after breaking down the problem, and understanding how to solve it - how can you be sure that this is the best possible solution? Have you ever found yourself wondering if this is the way to go, and it won't bring unnecessary headache later on? Have you ever wondered if your solution is too complex, and maybe there is a simpler way to do it? Have you ever felt this uncertainity when building software?

I know I have, many times.

I've written this blog post, to explore methods that can make decision making dilemma easier and help you achieve greater confidence in your decision making. Let's dive in.
